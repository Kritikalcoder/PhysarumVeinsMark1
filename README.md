The Processing code included can be run on builds of Processing post version 3. The executables will work on Windows. Access to the local webcam and sound devices is needed for the current version of the application.

The basis of the model was taken from the book "From Pattern Formation to Material Computation" BY Jeff Jones. The source version of the model can be found at http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/jeff/book/material.htm

To run the application, download the win32 or win64 folders and run the executable.
